1. Inspiration 
Today, people with disabilities face numerous challenges in:

- Navigating environments.
- Recognizing and interacting with people and objects.
- Facing a world not designed with their particular needs in mind.

In an attempt to the help people with visual impairment, we wanted to create an app that is able to detect what is visible in front of a person and read out the objects to them

2. What it does 

Utilizes Machine Learning and image recognition to determine what objects are in front of a user. 
Users can now walk around knowing that the world around them
Audio feature ensures that users can adequately understand objects in “sight” and anytime a new object appears, audio is played
